## 🎵 Spotify Dashboard: EDM Punk Playlist 🎶

A dynamic dashboard showcasing Spotify's EDM Punk Playlist, previously
updated with GitHub Actions.

### 🚨 Important Notice

Due to recent <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api" target="_blank">changes</a>

in the Spotify API, certain endpoints (such as those used to fetch audio
features and tempo data) have been deprecated. As a result, this
dashboard is no longer able to fetch and display updated data.

However, the codebase remains a valuable resource for learning about:

- 🎯 Spotify API integration.

- 🛠️ Building dashboard with R and the gt packag.

- 🚀 Automating workflows with GitHub Actions.

each song.
